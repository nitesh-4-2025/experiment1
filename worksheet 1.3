//Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.  Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee information.
// Employee.java
class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    // Default constructor
    public Employee() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
        this.salary = 0.0;
    }

    // Overloaded constructor
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = 30000.0; // Default salary
    }

    // Method to display employee details
    public void DisplayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
    }
}

// Main class to test the Employee class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an employee using the default constructor
        Employee emp1 = new Employee();
        System.out.println("Details of Employee 1:");
        emp1.DisplayEmployeeDetails();

        System.out.println(); // Just for better readability

        // Creating an employee using the overloaded constructor
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("John Doe");
        System.out.println("Details of Employee 2:");
        emp2.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
    }
